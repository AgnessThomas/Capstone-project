# Supply Chain Management
## Introduction
Warehouse Inventory Management is a supply chain management project that helps businesses keep track of their inventory in a warehouse efficiently. Warehouse Inventory Management simplifies the task of managing inventory in a warehouse, providing real-time insights into stock levels, order fulfillment, and inventory movement.
## Overview
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. In its instant noodle business, the company has discovered a mismatch between demand and supply, resulting in considerable losses owing to inventory expenses. The top management wants to maximise the number of product shipments from multiple warehouses across the country.
## Goals
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
* Focusing on all the steps of data science , including Exploratory data analysis, data processing, modelling, evaluation and visualisation.
* Highlighting new trends in dataset, providing  valuable insights and innovative approaches.
* Apply a variety of machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model that determines the optimal product shipment weight.
* Evaluate the model using the provided test dataset. These goals aim to help the company address supply-demand imbalances, reduce inventory costs, and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
## Data And Libraries
Data: The project uses both a train dataset for model development and a test dataset for evaluation.

Libraries: Key libraries utilized in this project include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
## Project Workflow
* Data Exploration: We begin by studying the dataset to learn about its properties, uncover trends, and discover insights that will help us with the optimisation process.
* Data Preprocessing :entails cleaning, dealing with missing values, and altering the dataset to make it acceptable for machine learning.
* Model Development: We create and train machine learning models that forecast the optimal weight of goods shipments from warehouses using various methodologies.
* Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using the test dataset to determine the prediction model's accuracy and efficacy.
* Data visualisation: is used throughout the project to present findings, trends, and conclusions in a clear and interpretable manner.
### This project intends to aid the organisation in making sound choices to optimise its supply chain and reduce inventory losses by combining data-driven insights and machine learning.
